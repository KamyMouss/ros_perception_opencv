# Notes
One of the most useful perception skills is being able to recognize objects. This allows you to create robots that can, for instance, grasp objects or understand the world around them a little bit better.
There are two main skills to master here:

* **Recognize flat surfaces**: This skill allows it to detect places where objects normally are, like tables and shelves.It's the first step to searching for objects.
* **Recognize objects**: Once you know where to look, you have to be able to recognise different object in the scene and localise where they are from your robot's location.

The first step in recognising objects is knowing where these objects are. For this, you are going to use a port of the **object_recognition_core** package to be able to detect flat surfaces and represent that detections in RViz.
